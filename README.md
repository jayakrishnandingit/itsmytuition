Itsmytuition is a learning playground for me. However, I have built a platform where you can mark your monetary expenses.

<h2>Pre-requisites</h2>
I assume you have prior knowledge in 
<ol>
	<li>Google App Engine</li>
	<li>Python 2.7.x</li>
	<li>Django Framework</li>
	<li>jQuery</li>
	<li>CSS3</li>
</ol>
Moreover you need to have these downloaded and installed.
If you are using linux machines you dnt need to install python.

<h2>How to use it</h2>
Make a folder Itsmytuition

Download the src file and add it to Itsmytuition and also to your python path.

create a folder named SDK and extract the app engine sdk here.

all you need to do is

open terminal goto /yourpath/to/Itsmytuition/sdk

type in <b>python dev_appserver.py /yourpath/to/Itsmytuition/src/ --port=8080 --datastore_path=yourpath/to/Itsmytuition/dev_appserver.datastore --require_index=yes --host=0.0.0.0</b>
